# How to Contribute

Commonground Church loves working together in community.

We want to make it as easy as possible for you to contribute changes. There are
a few guidelines that we need contributors to follow so that everyone is on the
same page.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the project
2. Clone locally
3. Install dependencies
4. Run ```grunt serve```

## Contributing Code

We use Github [like Github does](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyz3jkOBbQY).
That means we create a branch for every feature or bugfix. Once you're happy
with your code send a pull request. Pull requests act as code reviews and you
should never merge your own code into master.

This means all code has at least 2 pairs of eyes looking at it and ensures
a low bus factor and high community involvement.

1. Fork the project
2. Clone locally
3. Write your code, tests and documentation
4. Push your code to Github
5. Send a pull request
